# PAYMENT GATEWAY
# SIMPLE CRUD API WITH DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK
[Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Django 3.1
- Django REST Framework

## Installation
After you cloned the repository, you want to create a virtual environment, so you have a clean python installation.
You can do this by running the command
```
python -m venv env
```

After this, it is necessary to activate the virtual environment, you can get more information about this [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

You can install all the required dependencies by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure
In a RESTful API, endpoints (URLs) define the structure of the API and how end users access data from our application using the HTTP methods - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Endpoints should be logically organized around _collections_ and _elements_, both of which are resources.

In our case, we have one single resource, `movies`, so we will use the following URLS - `/movies/` and `/movies/<id>` for collections and elements, respectively:

Endpoint |HTTP Method | CRUD Method | Result
-- | -- |-- |--
`movies` | GET | READ | Get all movies
`movies/:id` | GET | READ | Get a single movie
`movies`| POST | CREATE | Create a new movie
`movies/:id` | PUT | UPDATE | Update a movie
`movies/:id` | DELETE | DELETE | Delete a movie

### Commands
```
Get all movies
http http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/movies/ "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}" 
Get a single movie
http GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/movies/{movie_id}/ "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}" 
Create a new movie
http POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/movies/ "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}" title="Ant Man and The Wasp" genre="Action" year=2018 
Full update a movie
http PUT http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/movies/{movie_id}/ "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}" title="AntMan and The Wasp" genre="Action" year=2018
Partial update a movie
http PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/movies/{movie_id}/ "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}" title="AntMan and The Wasp" 
Delete a movie
http DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/movies/{movie_id}/ "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}"
```
